IEEE format is a standard format for academic papers and journals, especially in the fields of engineering and computer science. It has specific rules for formatting the text, citations, references, tables, figures, and equations. If you want to submit your paper to an IEEE journal or conference, you need to follow this format strictly.
 
However, if you have written your paper in Word, you may find it hard to convert it to IEEE format manually. You need to adjust the margins, fonts, spacing, headings, numbering, and citations according to the IEEE style guide. This can be time-consuming and error-prone.
