How does Pingzapper work? Pingzapper works by creating a secure tunnel between your device and the game server. This tunnel bypasses traffic shaping, throttling, and restrictions that may affect your ping. Pingzapper also uses optimized network routes that are faster and more stable than the default ones. Pingzapper automatically detects the best server for your game and connects you to it. You can also manually select a server from the list of available options.
 
What are the benefits of Pingzapper? Pingzapper can help you lower your ping by up to 60% or more, depending on your location and game. Lower ping means smoother gameplay, less lag, and more responsiveness. Pingzapper can also help you avoid disconnects, packet loss, and other network issues that may occur in online games. Pingzapper can also protect your data from hackers, spies, and other malicious actors who may try to intercept or tamper with your connection. Pingzapper encrypts your data using AES-256 encryption, which is the same standard used by banks and governments.
 
How much does Pingzapper cost? Pingzapper offers a free trial for 7 days, which allows you to test its features and performance. After the trial period, you can choose from three subscription plans: Basic, Advanced, and Premium. The Basic plan costs $3.99 per month and allows you to use Pingzapper on one device at a time. The Advanced plan costs $4.99 per month and allows you to use Pingzapper on two devices at a time. The Premium plan costs $5.99 per month and allows you to use Pingzapper on three devices at a time.
